# Team SLA
Hi there! Welcome to Team SLA's GitHub repo! We are a robotics team preparing a line follower robot able to rescue victims and classify them into alive or dead. All the progress we make will be published here!
### Overview / Components
We are currently trying to clone a robot from a Robotics team in Singapur (all rights reserved) so that we can all learn how to build world-class robot without having to go through the regular process, which might take years!
The robot we are cloning uses the following components:

    - Raspberry Pi 4
    - Teensy 4.1
    - Camera: 0.3 MegaPixels USB Camera for Raspberry Pi / NVIDIA Jetson Nano / UNIHIKER
    - Giro Sensor: GY-951 INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNIT
    - ToF VL53L1X
    - Arduino Ultrasonic Sensors
    - Brushless DC Motor with Encoder 12V 159RPM
    - 2kg 300ยบ Clutch Servo
    - 2 Omniwheels 58 mm y 12kg
    - 2 Pololu Wheels 60ร8mm
    - 12V Battery
    - 6v Regulator
    - 5v Regulator
    - 60 PLUG Pins
